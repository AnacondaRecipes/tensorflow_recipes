  summary: Deep Learning Library for Theano and TensorFlow
  description: |
    Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library
    written in Python and capable on running on top of either
    TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling
    fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with
    the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
