# tensorboard is built as a noarch packages on a Linux system
# During the build, an executable is downloaded that requires a newer
# version of libstdc++ than that provided by CentOS 6,  Ubuntu 16.04 works.
build:
  number: 0
  noarch: python
  # Make sure there is no tensorboard entry point in the tensorflow-{gpu-,}base
  # packages as it conflicts with a file in this package.
  entry_points:

  # Although compilers are needed for the build, the output is pure python,
  # javascript and html. Therefore the run_exports can be ignored.
